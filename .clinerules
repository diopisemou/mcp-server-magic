# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /docs/adr for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Database schema changes
    Follow template in /docs/adr/template.md cerate it if it doesn't exist

## Code Style & Patterns

-   Generate API clients using OpenAPI Generator if we need to generate api clients
-   Use TypeScript axios template if the we neeed that
-   Prefer composition over inheritance
-   Use repository pattern for data access
-   Follow error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts
    Always make commits when updates are made and that you have human feedback that the app is still working perfectly

## Testing Standards

-   Unit tests required for business logic
-   Integration tests for API endpoints
-   E2E tests for critical user flows
