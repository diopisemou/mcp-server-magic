### Recently Decided

1. **Template System Enhancement**
   - Decision: Move from string templates to file-based templates
   - Rationale: Improves maintainability and enables community contributions
   - Impact: Requires restructuring template loading but improves extensibility
   - Status: Implementation in progress

2. **Edge Function Architecture**
   - Decision: Use Supabase Edge Functions for server-side processing
   - Rationale: Provides serverless execution without managing infrastructure
   - Impact: Tight integration with Supabase but potential platform lock-in
   - Status: Implemented with monitoring to evaluate long-term viability

3. **Marketplace Business Model**
   - Decision: Free community templates with premium partner templates
   - Rationale: Encourages community sharing while enabling monetization
   - Impact: Requires implementing template verification and subscription system

## Current Challenges and Considerations

1. **Generation Complexity vs. Flexibility**
   - Challenge: Balancing ease of use with customization options
   - Current approach: Progressive disclosure of advanced options
   - Considerations: May need to introduce template extension mechanism

2. **Performance with Large API Definitions**
   - Challenge: Browser memory and performance limits with large API specs
   - Current approach: Chunked processing and pagination
   - Considerations: May need server-side processing for very large APIs

3. **Deployment Provider Integration**
   - Challenge: Maintaining compatibility with evolving cloud provider APIs
   - Current approach: Abstraction layer for deployment operations
   - Considerations: May need to develop provider-specific plugins

4. **MCP Specification Evolution**
   - Challenge: Keeping pace with MCP specification changes
   - Current approach: Modular MCP implementation with version support
   - Considerations: Monitoring specification updates and planning migrations

5. **Code Generation Quality**
